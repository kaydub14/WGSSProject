# Searching for Trends in Technology Trends through Topic Modeling

#   Abstract

  Throughout the course of the semester, various topics have been discussed in terms of gender and work. One of these topics 
  stood out to me and caught my interest. Women within the technology sector often have to deal with difficult situations while working 
  in a male-dominated environment. In order to better understand these conditions, an analysis of two different topic models was done to 
  study various trends that occurred from 1945 until now. The topic models have served as a visual indicator of some research questions 
  that framed the scope of this project. Some of the questions are as follows. What topics were being discussed since 1945? Were women 
  included in the conversation of technology and the feminist movement? Why are other trends being discussed and not others? Are there 
  any noticeable trends that can correlate to external events occurring at that time? These questions are going to be answered through 
  the research and analysis that is done with the Signs@40 topic model and the topic model that was built by me using data from JSTOR. 
  The Signs@40 topic model, which was developed by Andrew Goldstone, is an interactive topic model compiled of all Signs articles that 
  were written from 1945 to 2014. Signs@40 was created in honor of four decades of feminist scholarship within the Signs journal. 
  All of the research and comparisons between the two topic models will be displayed on GitHub, an online interactive platform.
