# Searching for Trends in Technology through Topic Modeling

#   Abstract

    Throughout the course of the semester, various topics have been discussed in terms of gender and work. One of these topics 
  stood out to me and caught my interest. Women within the technology sector often have to deal with difficult situations while working 
  in a male-dominated environment. 
  In order to better understand these conditions, an analysis of two different topic models was done to 
  study various trends that occurred from 1945 until now. The topic models have served as a visual indicator of some research questions 
  that framed the scope of this project. Some of the questions are as follows. 
  
  * What topics were being discussed since 1945?
  * Were women included in the conversation of technology and the feminist movement? 
  * Why are other trends being discussed and not others?
  * Are there any noticeable trends that can correlate to external events occurring at that time?
  
  These questions are going to be answered through the research and analysis that is done with the Signs@40 topic model and the topic model that was built by me using data from JSTOR. The Signs@40 topic model, which was developed by Andrew Goldstone, is an interactive topic model compiled of all Signs articles that were written from 1945 to 2014. Signs@40 was created in honor of four decades of feminist scholarship within the Signs journal. All of the research and comparisons between the two topic models will be displayed on GitHub, an online interactive platform.
  
  # Research Trends
  
  I have included a link to the Signs@40 topic model [here](http://signsat40.signsjournal.org/topic-model/) and a link to the topic model that I created [here](https://kaydub14.github.io/dh-topic-models-2/) as well. Feel free to open both links and compare the two topic models and see if there are any trends that can be noticed.
